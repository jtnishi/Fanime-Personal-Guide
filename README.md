# Jason's Guide to Fanime
A basic guide for dealing with Fanime and San Jose from a congoer and San Jose resident.

---
## Overview

I'm putting this together before Fanime 2020 to help both those who have attended Fanime in the past as well as new attendees to note both some things that are worth knowing about coming to Downtown San Jose, as well as things that have possibly changed in Downtown since you've last come here.

Treat this guide as the state of things as of the latest commit.

If you see any errors, things that have changed, or have any tips, feel free to submit a pull request for inclusion.

*(Note: Most of the items here are applicable if you're also visiting San Jose to attend one of the other conventions happening at the San Jose Convention Center, such as Crunchyroll Expo.)*
