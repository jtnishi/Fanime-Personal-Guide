The convention center does have On-site parking, accessible from Market St. at E. San Salvador St., or from Almaden Blvd.  Expect this to be somewhat pricey during Fanime and to fill quickly.

San Jose also has a number of surface parking lots and garages for parking at during the day, with some usable overnight.  Consult [ParkSJ](https://parksj.org/) for more information.

Of particular note are the garages at [2nd/San Carlos](https://goo.gl/maps/ErEn7RhQ9XsbZYDd6), surface lots available on Almaden, a [surface lot on 2nd, just south of San Carlos](https://goo.gl/maps/Ty3vxL16VPuHToak6), and a couple of garages at [CityView Plaza](https://goo.gl/maps/FaYUkY2ZjJGc8QW68), though CityView Plaza is subject to change with construction expected to happen at the site in the near future, potentially before Fanime.  These will also all likely be busy during Fanime with the large influx of people.

### Ground Public Transport

#### VTA
The primary public transport systems for San Jose are the [VTA](https://www.vta.org/) Light Rail and Bus Systems.

While it should not generally affect most attendees for Fanime, you should be aware that the light rail lines and Bus Lines have changed significantly starting in 2020.  

In particular, the [light rail lines](https://www.vta.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/LR-map-jan2020.pdf) have been altered to split into 2 major North/South lines reaching from their southern endpoints at Winchester/Santa Teresa to endpoints in North San Jose.  The previous Winchester/Mountain View line is now the **Green Line**, and terminates on the north end at Old Ironsides station, near the Santa Clara Convention Center.  The previous Santa Teresa/Alum Rock line is now the **Blue Line**, and terminates at the Baypointe Station, on Tasman Blvd.  The new addition is a East/West line to handle the remaining stations from Mountain View to Alum Rock.  This line is named the **Orange Line**.  For most people attending Fanime, the Orange Line will likely be of little relevance, except if coming from Mountain View or from Milpitas, or if trying to go via rail to the Great Mall or either of the new BART stations.

*Of note: for folks used to taking the previous short Orange Line between Ohlone and Almaden station to get to Oakridge Mall in particular, the rail line has been discontinued, and you'll need to take a [bus line instead](https://www.vta.org/go/routes/64a) to get the last section to Oakridge.*

One change to the new setup will be a change of frequency on the North/South lines during the Fanime weekend, 15-20 minutes during the daytime hours to match BART.

#### BART (Pending)

Speaking of BART, also changing for 2020 is that hopefully by the start of Fanime, BART could be rolling closer into the San Jose area.  If BART service to Berryessa Station has started by Fanime 2020 (still an if at this point unfortunately), and you plan to come in via BART, your best bet will be to ride to the **Berryessa Station** from points beyond, and transfer to the new [VTA Rapid 523 line](https://www.vta.org/go/routes/rapid-523).  This will provide reasonably quick transit from anywhere BART reaches.  You can then get off at the Convention Center.

#### CalTrain

Alternatively, if you are riding [CalTrain](http://www.caltrain.com/) in from the rest of the peninsula, the situation mostly hasn't changed from previous years: ride CalTrain to Diridon Station San Jose, head out the tunnel to the light rail stop, and take a Green Line train headed toward Old Ironsides rather than Mountain View.  From there, it should be 2 stops to the Convention Center station.

This is also applicable to anyone coming in using any form of transportation that terminates at Diridon, such as the various bus services.

#### Bus (WIP)

### Flying
For those coming into San Jose, your best bet will be flying into [Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC)](https://www.flysanjose.com/).  Southwest is the dominant carrier at SJC, so your best bets for flights will usually be on them.  Alaska however does retain a sizable presence, and especially for west coast travelers might be an option.

If you're flying into SJC and wish to take public transit into Downtown San Jose, note that the bus line has changed.  The Airport Flyer route 10 has been discontinued.  Instead, you will want to take the [VTA Route 60](https://www.vta.org/go/routes/60) toward Milpitas BART and get off at 1st/Metro.  From there, walk to the southern platform and take a Blue Line or Green Line train, heading toward either Santa Teresa or Winchester respectively, and ride to the Convention Center station.

**NOTE: Route 60 is free to board at the airport. However, on return, it charges a normal fare.  For those planning on returning by using the Light Rail to bus to get back to the airport, you will want to consider using the [EZfare app](https://www.vta.org/go/fares/ezfare) (or a Clipper card if you're using one) to get the free transfer.**

Alternatively, you can fly into [San Francisco International (SFO)](https://www.flysfo.com/) or [Oakland International (OAK)](https://www.oaklandairport.com/), but expect drives/rideshare times of about 30-60 minutes.  Alternatively, take CalTrain/BART from the airports.  **Note that SuperShuttle has shut down and is no longer an option for traveling from the two remote airports.  For basic ground transportation, you'll need to use another carrier, or a taxi or rideshare service.**

## Expected Weather

[Via: The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/San+Jose+CA?canonicalCityId=ee73a6d3937103cfc433b87c3de033a410fbbb6ca7b2f873668a8b0989601d3f)

Average High temperature in San Jose during Fanime is typically mid/upper 70s, with Average Low temperatures around the mid 50s.  The Fanime period can be a bit swing-y with weather, from very warm and sunny to occasionally rainy.  Both have happened during Fanimes past.  However, that temperature average is usually fairly spot on for that time of year.  Bring sunscreen if you plan to be outside a lot, but otherwise clothing wise should be fairly comfortable to most folks.
